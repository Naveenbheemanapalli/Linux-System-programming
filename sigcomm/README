Assignment :- sigcomm

	-> have a process A send a 'message' to another cooperating process B via a real-time signal; the message is an integer value supplied to A as a parameter(s); verify that B receives it. This must continue until B receives the 'stopping' value -1. 


	This program cotains to programs namely sender and reciever we need to establish a communication between the processes and data integer values must be transfered through command prompt to the reciever and that communication is ended when the reciever recieves -1 value as input.

To Build the program run the command as follows
1) make
	When you run the Make file you will get 2 executable files namely
		1) sigcom_sender.out
		2) sigcom_reciever.out
		
2) then run the program as follows:- 
	You need to run the ./sigcom_reciever.out file and you will get the "PID" of the program which is used for communication
		 
	Then run the ./sigcom_sender.out in the another terminal and you provide the command in the format of 
		EX :- ./sigcom_sender.out		PID_obtained_from_sigcom_reciever.out		Data(int)_need to send 
			
	The Data you enetered will be seen in the Reciever terminal and when you send the "-1(Data)" as data in sender code the communication will be Terminated.
